# Defect log

One entry per defect. A defect is closed when the behaviour is fixed OR when it
is established not to be a defect; both are recorded, because a defect closed as
"not a defect" is a finding, not an absence of one.

Referenced from `docs/contract-decisions.md` as "the challenges log".

## D-013 -- Prefetch naive timestamps: UTC or host-local?

**Status: CLOSED 2026-08-27 -- library returns UTC. No correction applied.**

`windowsprefetch 4.0.3` returns run times as naive strings
(`'2026-08-23 22:57:15.832788'`). A naive value meaning UTC and one meaning
host-local are indistinguishable from the value alone, and the parser attaches
UTC either way. Under this lab's UTC+3 host offset, guessing wrong is a silent
three-hour error that would surface at verification as clock drift rather than
as a parser bug.

Resolved by comparison against ground truth (step 119):

| | |
|---|---|
| Ground truth, Scenario1.md action 2 (Execute) | `2026-08-23T22:57:22.536771Z` |
| Library P5 slot 0 | `2026-08-23 22:57:15.832788` |
| Delta | **-6.70 s** -- not a whole hour |

Confirmed independently of the library by decoding the raw `lastRunTime` bytes
as FILETIME: `134319994358327870` -> `2026-08-23T22:57:15.832787+00:00`, which
matches the library's string to 1 microsecond. The library's `convertTimestamp`
is a bare `datetime(1601,1,1) + timedelta(microseconds=ts/10)` with no `tzinfo`
and no conversion. Host is UTC+3; a localised value would read `01:57:15`.

**Consequence:** `_records` attaches UTC via `replace(tzinfo=UTC)`. Step 144's
offset correction is NOT applied. Confirmed a second time end-to-end at step 166,
where the timeline row for `INVOICE_SCAN.EXE` reads `22:57:15.832788Z`.

The residual seconds are artifact behaviour, not drift: Prefetch writes the run
time when the OS completes the application trace, seconds after the user action.
**Only a whole-hour delta indicates a timezone fault.**

Evidence: `docs/evidence/prefetch-spike-s1v2.txt`.

## D-019 -- collection_s1_v2 manifest covers 793 of 817 files

**Status: OPEN -- mitigated, cannot be fully resolved.**

The collection-time manifest omits 24 files (registry hives, transaction logs,
DPAPI blobs, `desktop.ini`). `clean-s1-v2-sha256-supplement.csv` was generated
2026-08-25 from the host copy and covers them, establishing integrity from
receipt onward rather than from collection. The lab VM was decommissioned before
the gap was found, so collection-time hashes cannot be produced. `clean_a` and
`clean_b` manifests are complete, verified by set comparison. See CD-017.

## D-021 -- stale file counts in documentation

**Status: CLOSED 2026-08-27.**

`docs/collection-manifest.md` and `docs/lab-setup.md` claimed 876 / 900 / 793
files on disk. Actual: **892 / 916 / 817**. The 793 figure was a manifest ROW
count mistakenly written into a files-on-disk field; row counts remain 892 / 916
/ 793 and are correct where they appear as such. All corrected.

## D-022 -- INVOICE_SCAN .pf filename assumed superseded

**Status: CLOSED 2026-08-27 -- NOT A DEFECT.**

Steps 109/114/134 anticipated that `collection_s1_v2` would carry a new Prefetch
hash, superseding `INVOICE_SCAN.EXE-A345C2FE.pf` in the docs. The spike at 117
recorded the actual filename: **`INVOICE_SCAN.EXE-A345C2FE.pf`** -- unchanged.

`groundtruth/Scenario1.md:188` already explains why: the hash portion derives
from the executable's full path, which is identical between collections
(`C:\Users\janed\Downloads\invoice_scan.exe`). No purge was required and none
was performed.

## D-023 -- windowsprefetch 4.0.3 misreads runCount on version-30 records

**Status: CLOSED 2026-08-27 -- corrected in the parser adapter.**

The library reads `runCount` at offset `0xD0`
(`windowsprefetch.py:239`), which is incorrect for version-30 records. Measured
across all 835 `.pf` files in the three collections:

| offset | files where `len(timestamps) > runCount` | files reporting 0 runs despite recorded run times |
|---|---|---|
| `0xD0` (library) | **610 of 835** | many, incl. `INVOICE_SCAN.EXE` |
| `0xC8` (corrected) | **0 of 835** | **0** |

`INVOICE_SCAN.EXE` reported `runCount: 0` against an execution confirmed by
ground truth and by its own recorded run time. At `0xC8` it reports `1`.

**Fix:** `_records` reads `0xC8` for version-30 records and falls back to the
library value otherwise. The correction lives inside the library adapter
boundary, so `record_to_events` stays pure. A run count that cannot be read is
omitted from `details` rather than emitted as zero -- zero is a claim the
artifact does not make.

**Contract impact:** CD-018 as originally drafted asserted `Events <= runCount`
holds *because the library drops empty slots*. That reasoning was backwards. The
conclusion (Event count is a lower bound, never a total) is correct, but because
the run-time array is capped at eight slots. CD-018 rewritten accordingly.

## D-024 -- zero-filled .pf files counted as parser failures

**Status: CLOSED 2026-08-27.**

Five `.pf` files across the three collections are runs of zero bytes:
`DEFRAG.EXE-738093E8` (clean_a, clean_b) and `SVCHOST.EXE-CE29B0F4` (all three).
Sizes 3664 and 5225 bytes, every byte `0x00`. Both appear in their SHA-256
manifests with real digests, so they were collected and transferred intact --
this is not corruption in transit.

Cause is the same allocated-but-never-flushed condition already documented in
`docs/collection-manifest.md` for the original clean_a's KAPE ConsoleLog: the
filesystem allocated size but contents were never written.

The library raised `AttributeError: 'Prefetch' object has no attribute
'filenameStringsOffset'` on each, which `ingest.py` correctly caught -- but
counted as `files_failed`, breaking the `0 failed` requirement at steps 164/177
and misreporting intact evidence as a parser fault.

**Fix:** `_records` yields no records when the header is entirely zero. An empty
artifact is an absence of evidence, not a failure to read it. The guard is
narrow (all header bytes zero) so a genuinely malformed file still raises and is
counted; a test asserts both behaviours. See CD-020.

## D-025 -- Op-*.pf SysMain files silently fabricated events

**Status: CLOSED 2026-08-27.**

`Op-EXPLORER.EXE-7A3328DA-000000F5.pf` exists in all three collections. These
are SysMain operational files with a different internal structure.
`docs/collection-manifest.md` already stated the parser "excludes them by name
deliberately" -- but `can_handle()` returned `True` for them.

Worse than a failure: the library parsed them **without raising** and yielded the
filename fragment `Op-EXPLORER.EXE-7A3328DA` as an `executableName`. The parser
emitted it as a binary with a run time. One fabricated event reached
`outputs/s1v2/timeline.csv` (869 events; 868 after the fix).

A run-summary failure count cannot detect this class of fault, because nothing
fails.

**Fix:** `can_handle()` excludes basenames starting with `op-` (case-folded).
Two parametrised test cases cover it. See CD-020.

## D-014 -- ruff I001 on parser registration imports

**Status: OPEN -- anticipated, surfaces at Day 5 integration.**

Two parser registration imports written as separate lines with only
`# noqa: E402,F401` trigger `I001`. Resolution is to add `,I001` to the first
line rather than switching to the parenthesised form, which would turn every
future parser registration into a multi-line merge conflict. Recorded in
`docs/contract-decisions.md` under toolchain rules.
